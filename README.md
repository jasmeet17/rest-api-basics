# Rest Api
This is implemenetation of basic REST APIs for a todo application.
Purpose of this applciation is to learn basics of REST API , Flask.
In this app I didn't use any data base.

====================================================================

I recommend the use of virtual env to run this application.
You may have to edit the path of the scipt at the top of the app.py class.
Use $chmod a+x app.py (to make it executable) and run using $./app.py
